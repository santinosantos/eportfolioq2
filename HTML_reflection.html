	<p class="bodytext"> This Second Quarter really enabled me to learn CSS efficiently. It showed me the connection between the CSS and HTML languages and using them via the different hands-on activities challenged me to really keep in mind the design and styling of the webpage. If I were to summarize all of the lessons in ICT in two words, it would be "careful creation". In coding, we have to be extra careful. Even a missing quotation mark, extra colon, and the lack of a bracket can affect even the minutest code. This is why I learnt that we have to express caution in utilizing code to form websites that can affect many people's internet experience. In addition, the other aspect of careful creation is the actual content of the website. A website, how amazing its technical aspects may be, is always evaluated based on design and content. We have to carefully identify what we put on those pages, so that we may utilize the internet as a beacon for social, informational and even self improvement for many and that it may disseminate correct and proper information to the masses of netizens. The Bini song "Karera" from above shows my newfound believe that <b> life is not a race, and that coding should also not be one. </b> </p>
